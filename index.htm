				<h2>About Our Foods</h2>
				<p>The term <em>organic</em> refers to the way agricultural products are grown and processed.Habesha Organic Food Shop assures 100% quality of its organic food products. Even though regulations vary from country to country, in the U.S., organic foods must be produced without the use of synthetic pesticides, bio-engineered genes, petroleum-based fertilizers, and sewage sludge-based fertilizers. Organic livestocks are raised for meat, eggs, and dairy products must be given organic feeds. Animals shouldn't be given antibiotics, growth hormones, or any animal by-products.</p>
				<p>We sell whole organic foods such as deli foods, food crops, vegetables and fruits. We also sell poultry, fish and dairy products. Our deli food includes beef, pork and lamp. We also regularly sell organic vegetables such as cabbage, cucumber, lettuce and carrot. Our organic fruit varieties include banana, orange, avocado and strawberry. We also sell food crops such as green bean, maize, wheat and peas.</p>

				<p>We want to improve the health of our society by providing healthy whole organic food. To do so, we established organic farms in cooperation with experienced farmers to produce organic foods. We proudly produce and sell our organic foods for our consumers. Our farmers use 100% organic resources to cultivate, harvest and process all foods we sell. All of our foods are free of artificial additives and preservatives.</p>
				<p>Prominent organizations such as the American Heart Association maintain that eating saturated fat from any source increases the risk of heart disease, other nutrition experts maintain that eating organic grass-fed meat and organic dairy products doesn’t carry the same risks. It’s not the saturated fat that’s the problem but the unnatural diet of an industrially-raised animal that includes corn, hormones, and medication to assure the quality of our foods, we work closely together with our farmers. We regularly monitor the quality of farms how they produce and process the our organic foods. We promote our farmers, advocate their food products and support them in certain circumstances.</p>

				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>We are highly committed to build healthy societies by expanding the supply of healthy organic foods to our community. Most of us have an accumulated build-up of pesticide exposure in our bodies due to numerous years of exposure. This chemical "body burden" as it is medically known could lead to health issues such as headaches, birth defects, and added strain on weakened immune systems. Artificial preservatives and bio-engineered foods have adverse side effects on our health. We have a strong mission to avoid unhealthy foods and additives from our foods to optimize our health.</p>
				<p>Our farmers produce whole organic foods by using natural resources as an input. They use natural fertilizers for crops, vegetables and fruits. They also raise their beef animals on natural feed basis. No artificial growth hormones are to be added to our products during production, harvest, and storage process until we sell our foods.</p>

</head>

<body>
	<main> <!-- The main tag replaces "container" divs in previous HTML versions -->
		<header>
			<h1>Header area, enclosing an h1 heading</h1>
			<h3>Often an h3 tag would be used for a subheading in this area</h3>
		</header>
		<hr> <!--This is a horizontal rule and is used here to separate sections -->
		<section>
			<article>
				<h2>First article, often the left column, enclosing an h2 heading</h2>
				<p>A p element, or paragraph, often follows a heading such as h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6...the six heading sizes from large to small. When you're first scripting a web page in html, it's often convenient to use "Lorem Ipsum", or greeking, as a text placeholder until you know the real content.</p>
				<p>This second paragraph within the first article will demonstrate how to "interrupt" a paragraph with a new line using the br tag. It's often used if you want to contain a long text string, such as <br?HACC, Centeral Pannsylvania's community College<br>on one line.</P>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Second article, often the middle column on a desktop PC layout</h2>
				<p>In responsive design, this second article is often used as the middle column on a desktop layout; when the screen is narrower, this article will wrap under the first article on a tablet or smartphone layout.</p> 
				<p>All three articles are contained with first "section" of the page. The <code>section</code> tag is one of the new semantic tag in TML5; this means they have significance in the logical structure of the page...not just for formating.
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Third article, often the right column on the desktop PC layout</h2> 
				<p>In responsive design, this third article is often used as the right column on the desktop layout; when the screen is narrower, this article will wrap under the first and second articles on a tablet or smartphone layout.<p> 
				<p>Two great places to find greeking are <a href="http://www.blindtextgenerator.com/lorem-ipsum" target="_blank">Blind Text generator</a> and <a href="https://baconipsum.com/" target="_blank">Becon Ipsum - A meatier Lorem Ipsum Generator</a>. In this paragraph's HTML you can see examples of the <code>a</code> (anchor) tag for links, its <code>href</code> attribute (hypertext reference), and its <code>target</code> attribute to open the linked page in a new browser tab. You also see three pairs of code tag, which is used to display text in the browser's "monospace" typeface which is usually Courier New on a <i>window</i> machine.</p>

			<h2>Internal Links - Within the Web Site</h2>
			<!-- Note that until we add other content to the site, these links will display a "page not found" message --> 
			
			<p>This is a <a href="../index.htm"> link to index.htm</a>, known as the home page and illustrates how to go UP one level from the pages folder to the "root" level (top) of the web site.</p>
			
			<p>This is a <a href="form.htm">link to form.htm</a> and illustrates how to link to a page within the same folder.</p> 
			
			<p>This is a link demonstrating how to <a href="pages/form.htm">get to the form page</a> from the root level of the site...an example of going DOWN one level within the site.</p>
			
			<p>This shows how to link an image on this page. In this link you go UP one level from the pages folder, then DOWN one level in to the images folder. There is not yet an images folder or a graphic of a dog, so you won't YET see an image.<img src="../images/dogie.gif"></p> 
			
			<h2>Quotations</h2>
			
			<p>The <code>q</code> tag is often used for short quotations <b>within</b> a paragraph such as <q>It is what it is</q>. You'll note that it automatically supplies the quotation mark </p> 
			
			<p>Use the <code>blockquote</code>tag to create indented and specially  formated longer quotations, much like your History or English professors would tell you to do in term papers. Her is a quotation by Dr. Martin Luther King, from BrainyQuot. You'll note how it's indented from both sides.</p>

			<blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/m/martin_luther_king_jr.html">
			I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality...I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.

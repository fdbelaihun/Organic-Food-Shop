				<h2>Sources of Our Foods</h2>
				<p>Our organic foods are brought from organic food producer farms. Our farmers raise, harvest and deliver organic foods to our shop. We evaluate and monitor the process of our organic food production from the start of cultivation until we receive them, store and sale. Once we approve the quality, then we receive and properly handle our organic food items in our shop until it's sold.</p>
				<p>Our farmers use organic fertilizers such as compost, humic acid, amino acids, seaweed extracts and natural enzyme-digested proteins.Decomposing crop residue (green manure) from prior years is another source of fertility. They also use animal sourced urea and urea-formaldehyde from urine as an organic fertilizer.</p>
				<p>Once the product is arrived in our shop, each product is stocked in the assigned bins with in the corresponding aisles. Deli products are stocked in the assigned bins with in the labeled aisles for deli products. Each type of deli food has its own assigned bins with in its aisle. Food crops are stocked with in the aisle which is assigned only for food crops. Each crop variety is also to be stocked only in its designated bins. Our vegetables are stocked in moisture and temperature controlled bins in the vegetable's aisle. Fruits are also stocked in well ventilated and temperature regulated fruit's aisle.</p>

				<h2>Production Process</h2>
				<p>Our food products are cultivated, harvested and packed by organic food producer farms. Farmers deliver the foods to our shop. Depend on consumption rate, we receive the foods, properly store and manage until we sell them to our consumers. The path we follow from production in the farm to the point of sale in our shop is as follows:<p/>
					<ol type="A">

						<li>Harvesting of Food crops, fruits and vegetables at the right maturity stage and slaughtering of beef animals.</li>
						<li>Packing, labeling and storing of Foods</li>
						<li>Transportation and Delivery to our shop</li>
						<li>Receiving the food products depend on the consumption rate.</li>
						<li>In-Store Management: After we received food items, then we store them in the designated storage rooms in the shop. Each food category has its own designated storage room. Each food category is also assigned to be stocked in the labeled bins with in the designated Aisles in the main shopping area.</li>

				<p>Organic is a labeling term that indicates that the food or other agricultural product has been produced through approved methods. The organic standards describe the specific requirements that must be verified by a USDA-accredited certifying agent before products can be labeled USDA organic.</p>
				<p>We directly involve in the process of our organic food production process together with the farmers. To satisfy our consumers' needs, we evaluate every aspect of our organic foods production processes. We inspect and evaluate the quality of the foods before placing them in our shop.</p>
				<p> We avoid and discard any food that doesn't satisfy our quality standards. We deliberately monitor the fat content of the deli foods, carbohydrate, moisture and freshness of fruits and vegetables. Each food type is inspected for certain quality parameters before selling hem. The deli products are packed and labeled with USDA standard labels. Expired food items are regularly discarded prior the due time to expire. We also monitor our foods for proper sanitation to minimize contamination and transmission of food born disease. Our shopping facility maintains optimal cleanliness and hygiene to inhibit harmful microbial growth.</p>

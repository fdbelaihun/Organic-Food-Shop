				<h2>Importance of Organic Foods?</h2>
				<p>Artificial preservatives and bio-engineered foods have adverse side effects on our health. Most of us have an exposure to accumulated build-up of additive chemicals in our bodies due to numerous years of non-organic food consumption. These chemicals are burdens for our body which leads to health problems such as headaches, birth defects, and added strain on weakened immune systems. </p>
				<p>We have a strong mission to avoid unhealthy foods and eliminate additives from our foods to optimize the health of our community.Our farmers use organic fertilizers such as organic compost, humic acid, amino acids, seaweed extracts and natural enzyme-digested proteins.Decomposing crop residue (green manure) from prior years is another source of fertilizer. They also use animal sourced urea and urea-formaldehyde from urine as an organic fertilizer.</p>

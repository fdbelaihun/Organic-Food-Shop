				<h2>Quality of Services</h2>
				<P>Our agreement to the standard of USDA is tailored to the quality of our organic foods. The PA state quality food marketing orders are binding regulations for the entire industry in PA, once it is approved by the producers and the Secretary of Agriculture. Our marketing agreements are only binding for us since we, the handlers, sign the agreement. As a result we are responsible to achieve higher quality of foods and as well as convenient shopping facility.</P>
				<p>The organized shopping area helps our customers to find the right food items without spending time. Our entire shopping area is divided and organized into major aisles and each aisle is also further divided into several labeled bins. Each food item is to be stocked in a separate bin under an assigned Aisle. This product versus aisle stocking technique helps to find the right item without spending time. This type of shopping area management is simple to handle products and easy to customers to find food items.</p>
				<p>For service improvement, we collect our consumers satisfaction ratings and comments. We guaranteed our customers offering fair prices which is competitive with other organic food sellers. We review our competitors prices and other related factors to offer the lowest possible price to all our consumers. Our goal is to provide optimum quality of organic foods with lowest possible price to our society.</p>

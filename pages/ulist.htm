				<h2>Area Organization</h2>
				<p>Our primary emphasis is to attain maximum quality of our organic foods so that there will be greater consumers' satisfaction. Based on our food variety we handle and better management system,our entire shop is divided in to four major aisles such as deli aisle, crop aisle, vegetable aisle and fruit aisle. Each aisle is subdivided in to several bins.</p>
				</p>The bins in the aisles are equipped with temperature and moisture regulation system. Each aisle is labeled with major food categories in which the assigned category of food is going to be stacked. The bins are also labeled with a description of a given food item which is assigned to be stacked in that bin.</p><br>

				<h2>Handling Techniques</h2>
				<p>We use refrigerator to avoid unwanted microbial growth and to extend the shelf-life of our food products. We also use freezer storages and boxed containers to transport our foods from the farm sites to our shop.Further more, we do regular and continuous monitoring and evaluation tasks. We strictly follow the standards of the USDA. Some of our evaluation and monitoring activities are mentioned as follow:</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Monitoring farms to assure they use organic resources as an input throughout the production processes.</li>
					<li>Attending the slaughtering process of beef animals, harvesting, packing, and stocking of all food products.</li>
					<li>Regular food inventory for expiration date and other defects in the store.</li>
					<li>Proper evaluation for USDA logo labeling standard for our organic foods which bears at least 95% (by weight or fluid volume, excluding water and salt) approved ingredients. Up to 5% of the food may contain prohibited ingredients, if those ingredients are not available in organic form.</li>
					<li>Follow the "first-in first-out" principles in the receiving and selling processes.</li>
					<li>Evaluation of the fat content of deli products.</li>
					<li>Monitoring the temperature, humidity and clean lines of the entire shop.</li>
				</ul>

Sanitation and clean lines of the entire shopping area is our basic responsibility to reduce the possible growth and transmission of harmful food born germs and its transmission in the process of our food production.</p>
				<p>Each respective aisle and bin has its own standards to properly handle a given food product it holds. The airflow, temperature and moisture handling system is different for different food products with in different bins.</p>
